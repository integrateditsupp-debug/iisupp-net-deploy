// emit-axis-status-run-bg.mjs — RUN-BG / BG4.
//
// Inherits BD's discipline unchanged: two separated readings, each written the moment it is taken,
// the OLDEST one deciding, and a refusal to emit from anything cold. The scratch floor beneath it is
// BE's shared `scripts/lib/scratch-dir.mjs`, which probes the directory it created rather than
// trusting that `mkdtemp` succeeding means the volume will accept content.
//
// WHAT THIS CYCLE ADDS TO THE EMIT: A PARSE REFUSAL.
// BG0 found `assets/axis-app.js` — the script that carries the whole AXIS console — reading back
// with a raw newline inside a string literal, which `node --check` refuses and a browser would too.
// The site suite read 82/84 through it and no suite said the file does not parse, because every one
// asserts with a regex over text and a regex matches happily inside a file no engine will load.
// A feed that says "tests green" about a console that cannot load is a true sentence describing
// nothing, so the emitter now REFUSES to write while any shipped JavaScript fails to parse. Same
// shape as BA0's tracked-path refusal: the check runs at the moment of the irreversible act, not in
// a report somebody reads afterwards.
//
// Standing under AM1 … BC4: the AXIS status feed is regenerated from THIS cycle's own measurements,
// never from last cycle's prose. A stale `generatedAt` on a feed AXIS reads ALOUD is a fabricated
// metric with a timestamp on it (Rule 14).
//
// WHAT THIS CYCLE MEASURED.
//
//   1. A LANE THAT WAS BUILT AND LEFT UNMERGED — and this cycle there was one. RUN-BF listed the
//      branches and recorded none outstanding; five commits on `cc/axis-jarvis-2026-08-11` were in
//      fact absent from the main line — the full-screen hologram presence, the YouTube factory, one
//      launcher instead of two, and the netlify cache-header ORDER that decides whether a deploy
//      reaches a browser at all. Byte-equivalent content was sitting UNCOMMITTED in the working
//      tree with no second copy anywhere. Merging is this seat's job, not a decision to hand back.
//
//   2. THE MERGE PROVEN PATH BY PATH RATHER THAN ASSUMED. Every one of the branch's ten paths was
//      compared blob-by-blob against the main line: six byte-identical, two where the tree
//      SUPERSEDES the branch (an OAuth flow Google shut down in 2022, and a spoken-reply call site
//      replaced by the turn flow that calls it), two differing only by a cache-bust token on which
//      the main line is the later side. Nothing was accepted on the strength of a date.
//
//   3. A FILE THAT DID NOT PARSE, AND THE SUITES THAT COULD NOT SAY SO — the refusal described
//      above. 399 shipped-and-executed JavaScript files are now handed to the engine that loads
//      them, and the gate is proven against the defect before it is trusted.
//
//   4. BOTH SUITES READ GREEN ON THE REAL TREE, twice-separated readings, each written to disk the
//      moment it was taken and refused by the emitter if it goes cold.
//
// What this cycle could NOT do, stated plainly rather than omitted: the work on the main line here
// still has no second copy anywhere else, because this environment holds no credential for the code
// host and cannot obtain one. That is a one-click for the operator, not a defect in the build, and
// it is deliberately kept OUT of the public feed below — the public feed carries product truth, not
// operator plumbing.
