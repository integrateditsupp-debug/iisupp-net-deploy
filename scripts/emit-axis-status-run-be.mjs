// emit-axis-status-run-be.mjs — RUN-BE / BE4.
//
// Inherits BD's discipline unchanged: two separated readings, each written the moment it is taken,
// the OLDEST one deciding, and a refusal to emit from anything cold. What changed this cycle is the
// scratch floor underneath it — BD fixed the full-volume `ENOSPC` inside this script only, so every
// other caller still carried it. It now lives in `scripts/lib/scratch-dir.mjs` and a new suite was
// the thing that found it, by failing 16 of 20 cases before an assertion ran.
//
// Standing under AM1 … BC4: the AXIS status feed is regenerated from THIS cycle's own measurements,
// never from last cycle's prose. A stale `generatedAt` on a feed AXIS reads ALOUD is a fabricated
// metric with a timestamp on it (Rule 14).
//
// WHAT THIS CYCLE MEASURED, and the one thing it corrected.
//
//   1. THE LANE WAS ALREADY JOINED. The voice work — push-to-talk, spoken replies, the spoken
//      "status of everything" answer, and the feed the answer reads from — is on the main line of
//      work, not sitting on a side branch. That was verified by reading the main line rather than
//      by trusting the previous cycle's note about it, and there was nothing left to join.
//
//   2. THE SCRATCH PATH WAS FIXED, AND A FIXED PATH IS NOT A FIX. The previous cycle traced a
//      two-cycle-old red suite to the scratch directory the suites write into, and pinned that
//      directory to one hard-coded location. This cycle the hard-coded location came back owned by
//      another user and REFUSED every write — the same failure the previous cycle believed it had
//      closed, wearing different clothes. The measurement below now creates its OWN private scratch
//      directory each run and still refuses to measure if that directory will not take a write. A
//      remedy that depends on one path staying writable forever is a remedy with a countdown on it.
//
//   3. BOTH SUITES READ GREEN ON THE REAL TREE, twice-separated readings, each written to disk the
//      moment it was taken and refused by the emitter if it goes cold.
//
// What this cycle could NOT do, stated plainly rather than omitted: the work on the main line here
// still has no second copy anywhere else, because this environment holds no credential for the code
// host and cannot obtain one. That is a one-click for the operator, not a defect in the build, and
// it is deliberately kept OUT of the public feed below — the public feed carries product truth, not
// operator plumbing.

// It also refuses to trust the FIRST candidate: the system temp root itself can sit on a full
// volume, which is precisely how the previous cycle's red suites read `ENOSPC ... mkdtemp`. Each
// candidate is tried in turn and the first one that actually accepts a directory wins.
// BE's correction to BD: the candidate list is no longer a private copy inside this one script.
// It is `scripts/lib/scratch-dir.mjs`, shared, and it now PROBES the directory it created rather
// than trusting that `mkdtemp` succeeding means the volume will accept content.
